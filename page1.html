<details>**The Whispers in the Walls**

    It was a cold, rainy night when Emily moved into the old, secluded house at the edge of town. It had been unoccupied for years, its peeling paint and overgrown garden giving it a forlorn, forgotten appearance. But Emily didn’t mind. She was seeking a fresh start after a painful breakup, and the house was cheap—too cheap to pass up.
    
    The first few days were peaceful, almost serene. The creaking floorboards and the distant sound of rain against the windows were oddly comforting. But on the fourth night, things began to change.
    
    It started with faint whispers. At first, Emily thought it was the wind, or perhaps her imagination running wild in the silence of the night. But as the days passed, the whispers grew clearer, more insistent. They came from the walls.
    
    Late one evening, as she lay in bed, trying to fall asleep, Emily heard it—clear as day—a voice whispering her name. 
    
    *"Emily..."*
    
    She shot up in bed, heart pounding, the room suddenly colder. She rushed to the wall, pressing her ear against the cracked plaster, but there was nothing. Just the faint hum of the house settling.
    
    But the next night, it happened again. And the next.
    
    “Emily… come closer…”
    
    Terrified, she began searching the house for the source of the voice, but there were no hidden speakers, no strange devices. The whispers were simply coming from the walls themselves.
    
    One night, desperate and frightened, Emily decided to confront whatever it was that haunted the house. She waited until the whispers started again, then, trembling, she followed the sound down to the basement.
    
    The whispers were louder now, like a chorus of voices, growing increasingly frantic. Emily descended the rickety steps, and as she reached the bottom, she saw something that made her blood run cold.
    
    The walls of the basement were covered in dark, dripping scratches—thousands of them, as if something had been trying to claw its way out. And in the center of the room, there was a large, rotting trunk.
    
    The whispers were coming from inside the trunk.
    
    Emily hesitated, then, with shaking hands, she opened it. Inside, she found the decaying remains of a woman—her eyes wide open, mouth agape in a silent scream. A tattered journal lay beside her, the pages yellowed and stained with something that looked like blood.
    
    With trembling fingers, Emily picked up the journal. She read the first page:
    
    *"I hear them… the whispers in the walls. They want me to come closer. They want me to join them."*
    
    Suddenly, the whispers grew deafening, as if the voices were all around her, pressing in from all directions. Emily dropped the journal, and before she could turn to run, a cold hand gripped her ankle.
    
    With a scream, she tried to break free, but the grip tightened, pulling her closer to the floor. She struggled, kicking at the invisible force that held her in place, but the whispers only grew louder, more demanding.
    
    And then, with one final, desperate cry, Emily felt herself being dragged into the darkness of the walls, the cold fingers of the house pulling her into its depths.
    
    The next morning, the house was silent again. The whispers were gone.
    
    But Emily was never seen again.
    
    And if you happen to walk past that old house at night, you might hear a faint whisper, carried on the wind, calling out to you:
    
    *"Come closer..."*</details>
